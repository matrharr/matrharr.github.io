      <p id="blog_text">This week has been by far the most challenging week and I guess it makes sense that the weeks will continue to be more and more difficult as we begin to work on more complex projects. We continued creating Ruby classes, diving into more complex class construction and methods along with learning a couple of new tricks to manipulate class objects, like the attr_accessor. Overall, although the week certainly presented challenges, I feel like my skill is in a solid place and my mindset in approaching these challenges is improving a ton. It is really interesting to work on a challenge and to truly get stuck in a spot where I'm not sure what direction to go.<br></br><a href ="http://matrharr.github.io/blog/ruby-classes.html">Continue Reading...</a></p>

      <p id="rec_text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
