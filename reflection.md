What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
- I learned that all of those values can make an impact on how things fit, or don't fit on the page. Using chrome devtools to play around with those values is also a helpful way to quickly get feedback on why something isn't working.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
- I learned that relative and static impact elements impact each other. That turns out to be a good thing when the size of the window changes, because absolute elements can lay on top of each other. So I came to understand that static elements are good, it's just a matter of getting them to work with each other on the page.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
- Working with the image was pretty easy, and manipulating text values is easy. I found that it was tough to make certain elements into sidebars and top nav bars. I had to better understand positioning values and display values.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
- I learned that devtools is a great way to play around with the code for quick feedback. Its important to use semantic elements to keep the css readable, use ids when its one thing, use classes when its several things, and always keep track of the position and display values of the big chunks of your site.
