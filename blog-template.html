      <h2>Week 1: The Command Line, Version Control, git and GitHub</h2>
      <i>12.3.15</i>
      <p>
       <br>The first week of DBC Phase-0 has been tremendous. In just a few days, I feel like I've gained some really good foundational knowledge concerning the command line, git, and GitHub. The curriculum is laid out in a straightforward, well organized way and whenever I get stuck there are a ton of resources to look into that provide different paths to finding the correct answer. So far, so good!</br> <br>Version control is a crucial component to writing code, and one way to do it is through using git and the website GitHub. Version control is basically the idea that as software(or any project actually) is developing, you will want to try out experimental ideas with your code that may or may not be something you want in the final product. In order to do this, you create "branches" off of the master code that allow to explore different possibilities. If the new feature doesn't break everything and turns out to be something good, then you can merge it back to the master code. Having the ability to move around like that is already great, but another huge component of Version Control is the organization of the edits. Being able to look back and see all the commits and even restore the master branch to a previous state are huge tools in effectively writing code.</br> <br>Git is a great version control system because it allows you to do all of these things pretty easily with relatively straightforward syntax. Simple arguments like "git status," "git add," and "git commit" give the user a lot of power and make it a easy tool to get things done.</br>

GitHub is a popular website that remotely holds software repositories. You can work on files with git locally, making changes that you want to certain branches, then upload your changes to the site. GitHub allows for collaboration on projects through their site and the use of open source code has flourished in recent years in part because of GitHub's popularity.

Thanks for reading! -Matt

<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
-It was great. I'm not an especially talented person when it comes to design, so it was great to work with someone who had some previous experience. By watching and talking to my pair, I think I learned some things about site design and what looks good.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
-Definitely. Once the wireframe was done and it was time to code, it just took knowing the syntax and writing out the HTML in an organized fashion.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
-Something that had access to the information we wanted to display and kept the look and feel of the other pages.
What new semantic elements did you learn about(if any)?
-In my research, learned about aside, article, nav, and used those in writing the code.
