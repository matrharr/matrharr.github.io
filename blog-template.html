<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
-It was great. I'm not an especially talented person when it comes to design, so it was great to work with someone who had some previous experience. By watching and talking to my pair, I think I learned some things about site design and what looks good.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
-Definitely. Once the wireframe was done and it was time to code, it just took knowing the syntax and writing out the HTML in an organized fashion.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
-Something that had access to the information we wanted to display and kept the look and feel of the other pages.
What new semantic elements did you learn about(if any)?
-In my research, learned about aside, article, nav, and used those in writing the code.
